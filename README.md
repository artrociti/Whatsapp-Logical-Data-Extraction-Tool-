# Whatsapp-Logical-Data-Extraction-Tool-
NOTE: This tool only works for rooted android phones. This tool was developed as part of a Mobile Forensics Bootcamp over a span of 1 day and hence would have a lot of limited features and bugs associated with it.

Go to the folder containing the python files, right click and select the terminal option.
When you run the Python file extract_data.py, it prompts you to enter the path to the com. WhatsApp folder of the root Android phone. Enter the file path and press enter.
The data is then saved in a json file called whatsapp_data.json
The program also creates image files showing graphs of the top 10 chats, top 10 contacts and messages over time.
Now run the report.py python file. This will display the data in a left-right sender-reciever style, similar to text message application format.
